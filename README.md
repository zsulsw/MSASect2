## Features
- **Comprehensive Analysis Functions**
  - MSASect2 offers five major analysis functions for Cross-sectional Properties, Yield Surfaces, Moment Curves, Member Buckling Strength, and Section Buckling Strength.
- **Advanced Geometry Support**
  - The software supports arbitrarily shaped section geometries, allowing for centerline and outline modeling techniques.
- **Consideration of Twisting Effects**
  - It is the new requirement in AISC360-2022. MSASect2 considers twisting effects for nonsymmetric sections, ensuring a more accurate member buckling analysis.
- **Robust Section Buckling Analysis**
  - The software employs both finite-strip and shell finite-element analysis methods for section buckling analysis.
- **Cross-platform and User-friendly Interface**
  - MSASect2 is designed to be user-friendly and compatible across various platforms such as Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

## Bugs/Requests
